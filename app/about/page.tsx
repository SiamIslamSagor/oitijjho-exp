                What does it feel like to hold a piece of history in your hands?
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                That question is what started Oitijjho Express. In 2010, we set
                out to protect the stories woven into Bangladesh's heritage. Not
                by putting them in a museum. But by keeping them alive in every
                home, on every table, through every product.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                It began with a few handwoven textiles and a promise to a single
                artisan. Today, it is a nationwide movement built with over 200
                families who carry ancient knowledge in their hands.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Each product we offer is more than an item. It is a thread of
                someone's legacy, a clay pot shaped by the riverbank, a textile
                dyed by memory, a spice carried from field to port with care.
                When you choose from our collection, you do more than buy. You
                become part of a living story.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                We partner with global buyers, retailers, and conscious
                businesses to bring these stories forward. Together, we are not
                just selling. We are preserving. We are uplifting. We are
                connecting roots with the world.
